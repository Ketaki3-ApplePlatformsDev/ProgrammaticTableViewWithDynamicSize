# SampleAssignment

This project is an example of loading dynamic data in table from URL and setting cell height dynamically at run time according to the amount of the data being displayed. It also has a refresh on pull down functionality It's an universal iOS demo application (i.e. for iPhone and iPad).

All the UI components are added programmatically (i.e. no use of storyboard or xib anywhere). Also the layout constraints are set programmatically.

Pods used:- 
1. Alamofire pod for calling service for data asynchrnously. 
2. SDWebImage pod for caching and image downloading and rendering. 
3. NVActivityIndicatorView pod for ActivityIndicator related styling

Architectural Design Pattern followed:- 
MVP 

I have added a few possible Unit Tests as well. I couldn't add UITest cases as I have experience of writing UITestCases when UI is created using Interface Builder and was short on time to learn it the other way at the time of solving this .

Project is documented properly wherever possible. 

Thanks. I hope this fulfills your expectation. :-)
